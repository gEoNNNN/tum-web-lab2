## Description

For this laboratory project, I created a landing page for a fictional coffee shop called COFFEEBOX. This immersive landing page is designed to offer a seamless, secure, and customizable coffee ordering experience while introducing users to the brand. The project is built using HTML and CSS, as specified in the requirement
